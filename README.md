# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera

**Deepening understanding of deep learning**

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction

This repo contains my work for this specilization. All the starter codes, images and course notes, unless specified, are taken 
from [Deep Learning Specilization from Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

## What I Want To Say

I took Prof.Ng's [machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course a long time ago, and that turns out to be a very fruitful course. I like his way of 
interpreting abstract concepts and I hope one day, I would be able to analyze and explain hard concepts or algorithms in a *clear
and vivid way*. And of course, I hope to have a systematical review on deep learning as well. 

Many of the knowledge covered in this Specilization, especially the first course [Neural Network and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome), 
are also covered in his Machine Learning. Therefore, I only uploaded assignments that are relatively new compared with his previous
course. For the overlapped part, you can refer to my [Github page of Andrew's Machine Learning](https://github.com/Bato803/Machine-Learning-with-Matlab/tree/master/Neural_Network_implementation) for
detail.
